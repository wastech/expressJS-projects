# What is Express?
Express is a relatively small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server func-
tionality to simplify its API s and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to orga-
nize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing; it adds helpful
utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects; it facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTML views;
it defines an easily implemented extensibility standard. This book explores those fea-
tures in a lot more depth, so all of that lingo will be demystified soon.
